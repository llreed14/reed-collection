## About the Collection

This collection of photographs is to share the beauty of nature and inspire others to take their own pictures. These photographs were taken by myself during a trip to Grand Junction, Colorado on a few of my hikes. The following three locations are where all of the images were taken:

- [Central City Masonic Cemetery](http://www.colorado-cemeteries.com/CentralCityMasonic.html) in Central City, Colorado 
- [Palisade Rim Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/palisade-rim-trail) in Mesa County, Colorado
- [Monument Canyon Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/monument-canyon-loop-trail) in Mesa County, Colorado
