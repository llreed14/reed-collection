## About the Collection

This collection of photographs is to share the beauty of nature and inspire others to take their own pictures. There were three main goals I had in mind when creating this collection. The first was to be able to share and make nature accessible to those who would not normally be able to view it in person. The second was to inspire others to take pictures themselves, and that they can do it on their phone rather than with an intricate and expensive camera. Lastly, it should encourage the viewer to embrace that each photo in the collection, and that they take themselves, is one of a kind. That there are moments that happen, however, when you capture them, it is a singular moment that wonâ€™t ever be replicated the exact same way.

Thes photographs in the collection were taken by myself during a trip to Grand Junction, Colorado on a few of my hikes. The following three locations are where all of the images were taken:

- [Central City Masonic Cemetery](http://www.colorado-cemeteries.com/CentralCityMasonic.html) in Central City, Colorado 
- [Palisade Rim Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/palisade-rim-trail) in Mesa County, Colorado
- [Monument Canyon Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/monument-canyon-loop-trail) in Mesa County, Colorado
