## About the Collection

This collection of photographs is to share the beauty of nature and inspire others to take their own pictures. These photographs were taken by myself during a trip to Grand Junction, Colorado on a few of my hikes. The following three locations are where all of the images were taken:

- Central City Masonic Cemetery in Central City, Colorado 
- Palisade Rim Trail in Mesa County, Colorado
- Monument Canyon Trail in Mesa County, Colorado
